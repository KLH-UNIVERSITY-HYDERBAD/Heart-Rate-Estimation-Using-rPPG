# Heart-Rate-Estimation-Using-rPPG

Remote heart rate estimation is the measurement of heart rate without any physical contact with the patients. During the pandemic period, telehealth and 

remote health monitoring have become increasingly important and people widely expect that this will have a permanent effect on healthcare systems.

According to the information from literature studies, we can say that deep learning-based methods generally give more correct and faster results than

traditional methods.

Health care has become pressing and important for people all around the world. Each human being is 

conscious of his or her own health. Especially after the global pandemic, we can see a boom in health and 

tech. Now a days everyone is trying to make health care like self-assessment, medicine delivery, diagnosis

 and online doctor consultancies accessible to common man where they can access it from their home 

itself. We think this project plays a part in that. Some people, because of their busy schedules, are unable to 

get to a hospital. To assist in this situation, we are developing the heart rate estimation project using rppg. 

This project helps individuals check their heart rate contactless. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is 

a contactless video-based method that monitors changes in blood volume by capturing changes in the 

intensity of skin pixels to measure the pulse.

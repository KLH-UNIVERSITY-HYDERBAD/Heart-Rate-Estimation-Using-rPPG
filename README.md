# Heart-Rate-Anomolies
Remote heart rate estimation is the measurement of heart rate without any physical contact with the patients. This is accomplished using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). rPPG signals are usually collected using a video camera with a limitation of being sensitive to multiple contributing factors, such as different skin tones, lighting condition of environment and facial structure.
